          <h2>9.1 Prototyping Tools and techniques</h2>
          <p>In the following part, I want to conclude, what kind of strengths and weaknesses the prototypes used during the last weeks carry and finally reflect on individual experiences I made with those tools during the course.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Paper
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths: </strong>In this course, we got the chance to go through the whole paper prototyping process. As it was guided (10 minutes prototyping, 10 minutes testing, 10 minutes for improving, 10 minutes testing), I got to know the real advantages of rapid paper prototyping for the first time, even though I did paper prototyping before. However, when I compare the paper prototyping process, we did in class to what I (tried to do) did before in other projects, I finally get, what this is all about: Putting all the core ideas / functions of a minimum valuable prototype on paper without over-engineering.</li>
          <li><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>Limitations are mostly found in user testing here: People interact with paper differently than they do with actual screens.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          <li>Balsamiq
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Great for low fidelity prototypes &ndash; easy accessible (drag &amp; drop ) example content to work with. No need to worry about style guidelines &ndash; everything can be black and white and be done in an efficient way.</li>
          <li><strong>Weakness</strong>: Balsamiq describes their tool using the term &ldquo;Mock-up&rdquo;, which is misleading to my way of thinking. That&rsquo;s why I assumed before, the tool is just as high fidelity-orientated as tools like Adobe XD or InVision but the least up-to date one.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Adobe XD
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Strenghts:</strong> From low fidelity to high fidelity, to using extensions like HTML export and developer review - With Adobe XD, you can basically achieve everything with ease. But facing the fact, Adobe XD can do everything also leads to one of the biggest weaknesses and potential pitfalls when it comes to using Adobe XD for low fidelity prototypes:</li>
          <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Using Adobe XD for low fidelity prototypes is complicated. There are no preset elements as mentioned in the case of Balsamiq&ndash; but creating basic elements could be just as easy here. However, once you created a basic element, there is a certain risk of getting to detailed already as things are really easy to achieve</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          <li>Audacity
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Versatile but still simple tool to do cutting and add fast effects. Reliable recovery function (saved my life once). It is Open Source and available on every platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) &ndash; interface didn&rsquo;t change for years, I got back to it within minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Need to download additional libraries (MPEG LAME), which might be irritating for some users&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>9.2 Tools and their role in the process</h2>
          <p>In order to conclude, which of the tools suit best for which stage of the design process, I will list and emphasize on every step / tool used in the research and design process.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Paper Prototype:</strong> This prototype step can be conducted already after the first session of ideation. The effort needed to create the prototype is comparably low and thus possible changes in the idea are fairly easy to implement. The user testing and feedback takes place face-2-face and hence can give a whole bunch of new insights and inspiration for improvements. In this step, everything is still possible. That is the reason on why even unforeseen events just as the user misses an important button entirely or finds himself overwhelmed by choices are not to be considered as critical failure of concept - but as valuable insights.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-visual Prototype</strong>: A completely new approach on prototyping &ndash; at least how we conducted it in class (I did voice UI prototyping before with a tool called VoiceX). However , I found, that even if sounds play a minor role in the software or product, the step of non-visual (or sound)-prototyping can be done in order to get more aware of the own product, as it somehow adds another layer of prototyping on the software and thus can be a source of new inspiration and ideas from another perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Low fidelity prototype: </strong>Before, I never used spend a lot of time for actual sketching and creation of wireframes on a low-fidelity level . However, during the course I found the given structure very helpful. It showed me, how valuable the creation of low fidelity prototypes can be, unless user testings are conducted during - and not after the lowfidelity prototyping : Insights gained from early stage user testings are still easy to change and as there is no real design involved yet, the user/client is not distracted by the design (he might not like at all) but instead focusses on core functionalities, placement of the most essential buttons etc.</li>
          <li><strong>High fidelity prototype:</strong> Before I attended this course, this probably would have been the prototype to start with &ndash; right after doing a few paper prototypes. However I found, that too much iteration within high fidelity prototypes most likely results in overhead - or carries the risk of spending way more times on iterations that could be done already before in the low-fidelity version and could have been taken into account for the high fidelity prototype.</li>
          <li><strong>Wizard of Oz prototype: </strong>Without any highly skilled developers involved, this type of prototype can be used to deliver the full scope of functionality to the user, although the technical / automatic component is still missing and thus &ldquo;emulated&rdquo; by the person who conducts the user test. This step is great to show the actual experience without the effort of a finished code. Therefore, I consider this step to be very interesting for us UX Designers &ndash; as we know basic coding, we can create the base foundation of code/design, mock any more advanced functionality and get actionable results without hiring an expensive developer.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>9.3. Evaluation on the course</h2>
          <p>In the course, I enjoyed the variety of tools we used, even though not expected them to use in my whole life again (e.g. Balsamiq &ndash; I used Balsamiq online before but back to the days assumed, the tool was made for the same purpose as Adobe XD and thus is not as powerful). Getting forced to use another tool, enabled me stepping outside of the box and leave the comfort zone of Adobe XD.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The fact, we were working on real world problems (fitness tracker, mobility app&hellip;) gave me a real motivation to create something unique and valuable. In general I am happy to see this approach is present in more or less every course: Working on solutions for problems people actually see themselves confronted with.</p>
          <p>As well, particulary this assignment added great value to my portfolio, as I applied for a mobility company for my internship and besides that want to be part at the &ldquo;Hackatrain&rdquo; event (a mobility-themed hackathon taking place in a train that goes all the way from AMS to Berlin for the TOA conference in July), where some references or experiences in the field of smart mobility could be handy.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I liked the big scope of prototype methods &ndash; sometimes even exotic ones I never thought about before e.g. the voice prototypes. I did Alexa voice UI prototypes before &ndash; but only with TTS but no naturally generated sounds.</p>
          <p>On deliveries, feedback and balance of work load: The feedback session in the middle of the module gave me some kind of milestone to work ahead for and reassured me, that everything goes fine thus far. Also even though it felt like the course with the highest amount workload to do in the whole module, it felt way more balanced and possible to achieve than other courses.</p>
          <p>What could be improved: The information on how to deliver the portfolio in the study guide was not that clear to me. As it said &ldquo;upload online PDF&rdquo;, I assumed that a PDF document in the cloud will be fine and did not expect to build an entire website for it until someone told me about that fact 2 days before the feedback. The fact we need to build an online portfolio website however I really liked, as it helped to recall the aspects learned in HTML/CSS.</p>
          <p>How I will apply in the future: To summarize, that course vastly shifted my mind concerning the process of prototyping. Especially when it comes to using more methods regarding prototypes we got to know more methods that enabled us to create engaging prototypes with way less effort needed than I spent on high fidelity prototypes in the past. But not only I will change aspects concerning my prototyping process. Before attending that course, I assumed that user testing is always linked to extensive user research and is bound to take a lot of time. But even the user testing sessions we conducted in the course during our assignments were way more valuable and full of insights than I expected, even though it was not really guided but really spontaneous and individual in the conduction. again - and the time spent for translating the insights to action steps was totally worth it, as the total time spent to apply those steps in the wireframe decreased with every detail defined in the action steps.</p>
