          <h2>4.1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>In this week, I am going to emphasize on the <b>process of high fidelity prototyping</b>, as our assignment deals with improving the low fidelity prototype from last week&rsquo;s assignment and turn it into a feasible prototype showing the product in a pre-final state.</p>
          <h2>4.2. The prototype</h2>
          <p>As I wanted to avoid a long <b>iteration processes within the high-fidelity prototyping</b>, I decided to emphasize on the last week&rsquo;s assignment and the evaluation based on user research conducted during the testing. With the action steps taken after the user testing, I improved the prototype in the mentioned aspects and thus made it ready to be <b>a solid base for a high-fidelity version</b>.</p>
          <p>Before starting with the high-fidelity version in Adobe XD, I tried to figure out, how to eventually <b>save time in the high-fidelity prototyping process</b> &ndash; or how to reuse already created elements in the low-fidelity version. As copying entire screens from Balsamiq to XD always ended up with static images, I tried digging a layer deeper and eventually found, that <b>single elements could indeed be reused</b>, won&rsquo;t make any difference in the overall appearance and could save me a lot of time (still just as image &ndash; not possible to convert the copied element to a text element / vector).</p>
          <p>For the overall design &amp; structural part, I got inspired by Google&rsquo;s Material Design. Thus, you will see many rounded elements in the final high-fidelity prototype. As the whole concept is fully based on the final implementation of week 3&rsquo;s wireframing assignment, you <b>will not find any major differences in structure</b>, placement of elements &ndash; as getting rid of many iteration steps in the high fidelity prototyping process was part of my strategy and possible due to conducted user testing.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>4.3. Expert review: Evaluation by a fellow student</h2>
          <p>As part of this assignment, we had to <b>recruit a person to evaluate each other&rsquo;s project</b> with. As my fellow students already provided me some feedback for the low fidelity version of &ldquo;TrafficHero&rdquo;, this time <b>I decided to choose someone, who is A) an UX expert and B) new to the concept of my public transportation app.</b> Niclas from class A did not hesitate long and delivered me a detailed evaluation sheet with <b>actionable steps for possible changes and improvements</b>.</p>
          <figure class="figure">
              <p>Attached, you can find both, the <b>original evaluation</b> and an <b>annotated version</b> from my notes that would be crucial for the further development of TrafficHero.</p>

          <h2>4.4. Reflection on expert review: possible implementations</h2>
          <p>As the Expert review ended up to be very detailed, I decided to <b>analyze every single aspect </b>mentioned in the expert review through going a step backwards: I opened the prototype file and tried to understand, what Niclas was trying to tell me, as <b>not every critic point was entirely clear to me from the beginning</b>.</p>
          <p>In order to filter, prioritize and rephrase the needed action steps in my words, I <b>created a reflection sheet on the expert review</b>, where I included every single aspect from my notes and <b>defined further steps on how to improve each aspect mentioned</b>. Please find this sheet attached:</p>
          
          <figure class="figure">
              <p>Attached, you will find the <b>evaluation of the expert review</b>, Niclas conducted before, including <b>steps for further development</b> of the TrafficHero app.</p>

          <h2>4.5. Reflection on high fidelity prototyping process</h2>
          <p>Just another week later &ndash; and I am glad to tell that with this assignment I was able to <b>experience yet another learning curve</b>. Thanks to a strong focus in the process of low-fidelity prototyping, I was able to realize the high-fidelity version with m<b>ore confidence, a fraction of time effort and a way better workflow</b> comparing it to past projects. Thus, <b>I had more time to discover</b> and scoop out features in XD, that I never got to use before: just like &ldquo;Symbols&rdquo;, that <b>allows quick global changes</b>, instead of using grouped layers that are at <b>risk of getting inconsistent while iterating</b>. All in all, a small but valuable insight that could potentially <b>save a lot of time during high-fidelity iterating in future projects</b>.</p>
          <p>Even more value, to my surprise, I yet again gained from talking with &ldquo;my&rdquo; users. The amount of input <b>enabled me to come up with new ideas</b> on how to improve/implement existing or new features.</p>
