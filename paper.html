          <h2>1.1. Introduction</h2>
          
        <p>
          The subject about our first assignment dealt all about small screens and was meant to apply our just gained <b>low-fidelity paper
              prototyping skills</b> to a new context: A small screen. To get more specific: We had to create a quick paper prototype for a <strong>fitness tracker app</strong>, which should be 
          both applicable for <strong> the smartphone</strong>, but also the users’ <strong>smartwatch</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essential functions as mentioned in the assignment were:
          <ol>
            <li>a start – and stop button</li>
            <li>track burned calories, travel distance and current speed</li>
            <li>real-time information display</li>
            <li>daily/weekly/monthly view</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>1.2. The first draft</h2>
        <p>I decided, to implement every <strong>essential function</strong>, but
          instead of needing the user to manually start an activity, to automatically
          detect the users’ activity while displaying live data and giving the
          opportunity of either tagging the current activity from when it was first
          detected or to reset the current activity.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1: The first draft using a very minimalistic approach.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        


        <h2>1.3. Feedback session</h2>
        <p>
          Within the assignment, we conducted a feedback session with at least one
          fellow student.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sample size: </strong>
          <em>magical number</em>
          of 3 people
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first instance, I advised my user, to just start with the
          application (without giving any advice. However, he was not that sure about, where to
          start and on how the tagging-feature relates to the live information. As
          well, users felt irritated by the large “swipe-down”-area, which leads to
          daily, weekly and monthly views. As well, they noted, that there was not
          yet a way to pair an accessory.
        </p>
        <h2>1.4. Improvements: Prototypes after the feedback</h2>
        <p>After creating actionable steps derived from the user feedback, I
          immediately started with applying the gained insights in yet another rapid
          paper prototyping session. The outcomes were as follows:


          <ul>
            <li>Smaller swipe-area (don't put users at risk, to accidently swipe down)</li>
            <li>Elaborate on live data as mentioned in the assignment (color, coded,
                largest space)</li>
            <li>Decluttered the interfaces for a clearer navigation</li>
            <li>Added a Setting-page where users can pair/unpair their devices</li>
            <li>Encourage use of icons instead of text in the smart watch screen</li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>
          1.5. Reflective conclusion: Lo-fi-paper prototyping
        </h2>

        <p>Without any doubt: This assignment got my <strong>relationship towards paper prototyping</strong> to a completely new level. &nbsp;Mainly I was impressed by the fact, how fast it &nbsp;suddenly was possible to <strong>design for 10 minutes, &nbsp;test another 10 minutes and design again</strong>.
          The things we tested were <strong>the most simple prototypes one might think of</strong>, that still contained all of the ideas covered in the ideation process/requirements.</p>
      <p>In the end, experiences and usability tests gave me way <strong>more actionable insights than I expected</strong> from this assignment. That&#39;s when I realized &nbsp;the <strong>importance of conducting lo-fi prototypes</strong>&nbsp; was completely
          new to me - or maybe I &nbsp;underestimated the topic before as I never used to like paper &amp; hand writing tasks. But for the sake of valuable insights in the early development process, this part will definitely play a more certain role in my future
          projects. &nbsp;Let me give an example: In Project for Bespoke Design, we focussed a lot on our end-result and that&#39;s where a gross part f the creative process took place. What I back then might perceived as normal <strong>iteration steps within the hi-fi prototype, probably made things more complicated than needed. </strong>My
          learnings: Invest time in lo-fi: A solid framework is the essence of every bigger (construction) project. (Just take the Berlin Airport, &nbsp;which takes forever to be finished as things went wrong from the beginning).</p>
