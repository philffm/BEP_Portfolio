            <h2>5.1. Introduction: The assignment</h2>
            <p>This week&rsquo;s prototype was meant as an excursion to AB-testing. The overall subject dealt with visual hierarchy, thus we were able to choose between different topics: Gaze following, Scanning patterns or color &ndash; however, we were free to make any other suggestion. As I stumbled over a related issue in my last week&rsquo;s ID2-project, where we defined the information architecture and design for our own online shop, I asked my lecturer whether I could conduct an AB-Test for one particular page of this online shop.</p>
            <h2>5.2. Preparing the test</h2>
            <p>In the end, we came to the agreement, that the following hypothesis could deliver interesting insights: &ldquo;Adding a &ldquo;bottom buy box&rdquo; to a product page can lead both to higher conversions &amp; shorter time to action.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The online shop was already created in Adobe XD. In order to prepare the prototype for my AB-Test, I followed the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Create second version of desired appearance (incl. a bottom &ldquo;add-to cart&rdquo; button, that gets visible, once a certain scroll state is reached (what in particular didn&rsquo;t work out, but I had the design for now)</li>
            <li>Took the base design and exported it using the &ldquo;Velara 3 Web Export&rdquo;-plugin in Adobe XD. - This resulted in a messy html &amp; css files and a bunch of even messier assets.</li>
            <li>Reorganized layers in XD, to get a cleaner HTML structure &ndash; <strong>Learning: </strong>Reorganizing layers in XD worked quite well and resulted in a reasonably bettter structure in the exported HTML & CSS.</li>
            <li>Defined divs where needed, told them to float on the top layer and stick to the top/bottom</li>
            <li>Included JavaScript file, that randomizes the played out prototype version, tracks the scroll state and shows the altered bottom buy button if top buy button is out of vision</li>
            <li>Included Google Tag Manager / Analytics script, defined all element triggers, variables, event trackers in Google Tag Manager</li>
            <li>Tested every possible action whether tracking in Google Analytics works</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>5.4. Observation: Participants and insights</h2>
            <p>As mentioned on the setup document, my conducted testing consists of two sources of data:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Quantitative user testing<br /> </strong>Live URL with instructions - possibly big test group</li>
            <li><strong>Qualitative User testing <br /> </strong>Test-setup in class</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When I conducted the qualitative user testing in class, I began using the URL where a randomized test version is played out. However, the randomize function returned the version A, which I was less interested to test, way more often. That&rsquo;s why I decided to include a custom variable, so the accessed URL decides which test is shown. That gave me the ability to better control the trial in class. However, tests after the trial (Google Analytics) showed that the randomize-function factually worked and showed variant A just as often as variant B.</p>
            <p>The user trial in general showed me yet again, how much value qualitative user trialing can actually add. Plenty of my participants decided to take the top buy button instead of the bottom buy button as predicted in my hypothesis. Of course, I was curious about that: So I asked them not, why they didn&rsquo;t go for the bottom buy box, but asked whether they actually saw a different way of putting the article to the shopping cart.</p>
            <p>I got the following answers:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Oh, it appears during scrolling &ndash; I was looking at the content</li>
            <li>I perceived it &ndash; but I saw the top buy button before, so I knew I just had to scroll up again to add the article</li>
            <li>Maybe make it bigger? Or floating?</li>
            </ul>

                </a>

            <h2>5.5. Gathering data in Google Analytics</h2>
            <p>User trialing in class was not enough for me &ndash; so I shared the prototype with some friends in order to gain further insights. My main insight was: They behaved similar &ndash; but without the user trialing, I would probably still be looking for the needle in the haystack, trying to optimize a fail-proof concept. However, with the gained user insights, a new direction was paved: Version C with a possibly bigger, floating buy box.</p>

            </figure>             
            

            <figure class="figure" >

                <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Caption 2:</strong> extract of Google Analytics data: B-Version with &ldquo;Add-to-cart&rdquo;-Button in the bottom, as stated in the hypothesis, performs better in terms of user goals: In version B, the article makes his way to the cart way faster using the bottom buy box than in cases, users decide to click the top button.</p></figcaption>
            </figure>          

            <h2>5.6. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This assignment showed me yet another time, how important user trialing can be &ndash; not only in order to validate hypothesizes, but also to gain new insights, that can be used to improve the prototypes being tested and pitch it towards the best possible solution.</p>
