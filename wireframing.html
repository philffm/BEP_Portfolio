            <h2>3.1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This week, we continued our journey in low-fidelity prototyping by creating a structure / information architecture (IA) for a web platform.</p>
            <p>The task was, to conceptualize a travel planning app (desktop or mobile) in a lo-fidelity way that allows not only fast changes but also serve as basis for the high-fidelity prototype of next week&rsquo;s assignment.</p>
            <p>Another step to dare this week deals with the choice of our tools. In order to build this loFi-prototype, we were invited to choose an entirely new prototyping tool. As I had experience in Adobe XD, InVision (and Balsamic Web) already (and knew,
                that low-fidelity is hard to achieve with those tools, as the variety of tools can be a pitfall and often (already in the early stage) leads to complex, high fidelity prototypes), I went for the Balsamiq Desktop version this time.</p>
            <h2>3.2. Rephrasing the given requirements</h2>
                <p>Within the assignment, we had certain guidelines/requirements given, the prototype has to feature. In order to have a quick brainstorm / ideation about every particular function, I decided to rephrase those requirements, created
                    a sheet with colorful priorities and added ideas for every core function of the website. In the last column, I assigned every function a possible screen (keeping the given priority in mind), so I could start with wireframing right after
                    with a rough idea in my mind (and written down in this sheet ), where to place which core function without leaving out a detail.</p>

                <h2>3.3. Wireframes</h2>
                <p>The process of wireframing in this assignment consists of the very first wireframe, I created during class, the user testing, translating user insights to action steps and the improved prototype. </p>
                
                    <h3>3.3.1. The first wireframe</h3>
                    <p>Time was crucial part in this exercise, so I took my just created structure and translated the best ideas to a visual interface consisting of 4 screens. </p>
                    <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>The home screen (assuming, the person wants to start his trip right now, from his current location with the ability to adjust time settings and means of transport)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Destination selector (shows last locations and gives ability to search new locations)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Route selection (shows different routes from A to B incorporating with different means of transport. Instead of using a CO2-value, I decided to use words and colors - as this could have a more significant effect than confronting users
                                    with plain numbers)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Map view (shows map with search option as well as POI-layer to access nearby places with a click/touch)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    
                        <figure class="figure">

                    <h3>3.3.2. The feedback session: How I tested the wireframes</h3>
                        <p>In order to conduct the feedback session, I made the loFi-prototype &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; through linking the artboards in Balsamic.  I asked 3 different people to participate. (1 person in class, my flatmate and another friend) </p>
                        <p>During the test, I asked my test candidates to speak up whenever they run into a problem or miss a certain aspect - in order to get realistic and applicable insights. </p>
                        <p>Back to my spreadsheet, I collected the data and evaluated their priority. And to my surprise, they were all relevant enough to get translated into action steps</p>

                <h2>3.4. Reflecting on Wireframing &amp; Usability testing</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>In the beginning, I was uncertain about my choice to start with rephrasing the requirements in a spreadsheet, developing fast ideas and allocate those ideas already to a screen in the wireframe. I felt uncertain about that step, because people
                        around me didn&rsquo;t do it like that. But in the end, this just took me 15 minutes to create and left still enough space for further iteration and expansion. For me, this was the way to go as in the following step I roughly
                        spent 30 minutes on my first lo-fi wireframes. I am convinced, this was just possible through having a solid structure to build on without the need to rethink, go back, change and revert steps in between.</p>
                    <p>The feedback was more valuable than I expected, yet again - and the time spent for translating the insights to action steps was totally worth it, as the total time spent to apply those steps in the wireframe decreased with every detail defined
                        in the action steps. </p>
                    <p>After applying the given action steps to the wireframes (that were still lo-fi!), the service already felt like a fully-featured tool - to my surprise even more functional than some of my high-fidelity prototypes in earlier
                        design stages - with a fraction of time spent for a higher functionality. Again, this was  a proof for the fact, that focussing on lo-fi prototyping makes totally sense. With those basic wireframes, I would claim to be
                        finished by 80% already - without even started the high fidelity prototype of next week&rsquo;s assignment.  </p>
